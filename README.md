===================
An experimental project of a dice based game wirtten in Django. Loosely based on the board game 'King of Tokyo'.

Each turn consists of 3 rolls of the 6 die. After each roll you can choose which die you want to hold sa the same value.

The dice are five sided with the following faces:
Attack
Heart
1
2
3

Get three of the same numbers (eiither 1, 2 or 3) to earn that number of victory points. Get 1 extra point for each addition dice of the same face.

Each attack takes 1 health point off your opponent. Each heart recovers 1 health point for yourself.

Each player starts on 10 health and 0 victory points. Win by killing your opponent (getting their health to zero), or reaching 20 victory points.

This project is currently under development.
